LITHUANIA, my country, thou art like health; how much thou
shouldst be prized only he can learn who has lost thee. To-day
thy beauty in all its splendour I see and describe, for I yearn for

the number of sheaves that up and down the meadows shone
thick as stars—one could see from the number of ploughs turning
up early the immense tracts of black fallow land that evidently
belonged to the mansion, and were tilled well like garden beds,
that in that house dwelt plenty and order. The gate wide-open
proclaimed to passers-by that it was hospitable, and invited all to
